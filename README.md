I deployed a Reddit clone application on a Minikube cluster, creating a scalable and containerized local environment for testing and development. The deployment uses Kubernetes to manage application components, such as the frontend, backend, and database, ensuring efficient resource allocation and high availability. Minikube provides a lightweight Kubernetes environment that allows for rapid iteration and testing before deploying to a production cluster. This setup enables seamless scaling and management of application components, leveraging Kubernetes features like Pods, Services, and ConfigMaps. The result is a fully functional Reddit clone running in a controlled, scalable, and isolated environment, ideal for development and testing.
